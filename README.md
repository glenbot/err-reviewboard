## Known issues

Currenly if the URI of your API is under a subdirectory ex (http://your-uri/reviewboard/api), the linking in the chat will not work correctly. The API endpoint that review board provides does not have a solid link to the review unless you make two queries to the API. Code just needs to be updated.
